## 💎 Key Features

Obsidian currently offers Publish services ($20/month) with advance features. This starter is a free alternative for Obsidian users who want to publish their digital garden as a website. Obsidian can also serve as an on-device CMS to manage your content. (Cross-platform synchronization is also possible via Obsidian Sync / [Git](https://desktopofsamuel.com/how-to-sync-obsidian-vault-for-free-using-git/?utm_source=github&utm_medium=readme&utm_id=starter-obsidian))

<Features />

<!-- - Publish your [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/) knowledge base as a website for free using [Gatsby](https://gatsbyjs.com/)
- Support YAML (e.g. tags, publish) that are also supported by Obsidian -->

## 🚀 Getting Started

### 1. Create a Gatsby site.

Clone this template and navigate into the folder

```node
# Create a gatsby site with npx
npx gatsby new project-name https://github.com/juxtdesigncc/gatsby-starter-obsidian-garden
cd project-name

# or
git clone https://github.com/juxtdesigncc/gatsby-starter-obsidian-garden project-name
cd project-name
```

### 2. Install dependencies.

Install dependencies using yarn or npm

```
# Using yarn
yarn install

# Using npm
npm install
```

### 3. Run development server

Let's run the dev server to know it's working before updating any content or code.

```
gatsby develop
```

Your site is now running at http://localhost:8000!

### 4. Open the code and start customizing

Start customizing:

- `/content/vault` stored all demo content. You can also use Obsidian to open the folder as a vault.
- `/config.js` to customise the site metadata, top and footer navigation
- `/gatsby` to customise all page generation in `gatsby-node.js`

```
code .
```

## 💻 Setup

**Read before you use your own Obsidian vault or create a new one**

Whether you wish to use your existing Obsidian vault or start a new vault, the following Obsidian preferences has to be set up correctly. Starting a new vault is highly recommended as these options are not on by default. All existing notes using the `[[Wikilinks]]` will need to update manually. Here're a list of preferences:

- Settings - Files & Links: Use [[Wikilinks]] option should be OFF. It will change the link format from `[[Wikilinks]]` to `[MarkdownLink]`.
- Settings - Default location for new attachments: Should be set as 'In a folder specificed below' and create a folder named `media`, remember to update the config in `gatsby-source-filesystem` in `gatsby-config.js` if the media folder has changed.
- By default, all notes will be published , but add frontmatter `publish: false` to hide a note.

Current example vault in `/content/vault` has already implemented all the aforementioned preference settings

### Why `gatsby-remark-relative-images` need to be not the latest version?
